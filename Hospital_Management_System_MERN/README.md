# HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

TECH STACK: MERN (Mongo DB, Express js, React js, Node js)

The healthcare industry is facing numerous challenges, and one of the most pressing issues is managing patient information and streamlining the processes involved in a hospital. This is where a robust hospital management system comes into play. Our proposed solution, a MERN-based project, aims to tackle these challenges head-on by offering a comprehensive platform for managing all aspects of a hospital, from booking appointments to creating prescription reports. 
This system will allow patients to easily book appointments, view their prescriptions, and access their medical records. Doctors will have access to a patient's previous records and be able to add medicines to existing prescriptions, ensuring continuity of care. The platform will also have an admin view that provides full control over the system and its operations. 
With our MERN-based hospital management system, we aim to revolutionize the healthcare industry and make it more efficient, effective, and patient-centric.

The hospital management system based on MERN will be designed with simplicity and functionality in mind. Our goal is to build a platform that includes a dashboard, appointment booking page, patient history page, and administrative page. Each page will be user-friendly and intuitive, ensuring a smooth experience for both patients and healthcare providers. The functionalities and tasks that a user can perform are determined by the type of account they have. For example, only administrators and doctors will be able to change appointments, while patients will have limited functionality due to security concerns. The administrative page grants the admin the authority to carry out most system operations.
