                            <p class = "text">Cliff diving isn’t for everyone to attempt, but it sure is fun to watch the pros do it. The death-defying leaps, flips, and twists from towering clifftops and rock ledges belong to one of the oldest extreme sports in the world. Cliff-diving daredevils, usually skilled locals trained in carrying on this athletic legacy, can be found performing for tourists in locations around the world. If you’d like to see it for yourself, here are a few places where you can witness these brave or crazy (take your pick) athletes dive from great heights that are often quadruple the height of the Olympic games’ tallest diving platform, which is 10 meters high.

                            <p class = "text">When most people think of skiing or snowboarding in the United States, large resorts with mountainous terrain probably come to mind. Popular places like Aspen, Park City, and Jackson Hole often have breathtaking views of peaks, massive amounts of varied runs, picturesque gondolas or trams, and multiple options for on-mountain dining. However, there are numerous less obvious spots to ski that offer less crowded slopes, better bang for your buck and, in some cases, pure novelty. Some don’t even  require cold weather! Here are a few worth checking out.

                            <p class = "text">The corona virus has turned the world and insurance policies upside down since January 2020! While travel insurance policies typically don’t cover fear of travel or help with the anxiety about re-starting travel plans, the right plan can and will cover a plethora of potential scenarios. Travel insurance is no longer optional; it is an added expense that is needed to be able to travel. After hundreds of thousands of travelers have lost deposits, non-refundable tickets and activities because of the coronavirus outbreak, it’s more or less mandatory and HEAVILY advised even more so than before. We discuss the WHY, the WHO, the HOW to help you understand not only the importance of covering your bases abroad but the best way to go about it.</p>
